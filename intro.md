Each Accountabilty Group (or EntreTeam) will be a totally voluntary, sharing level optional, working to help make each other better collaboration. 

It is not a venue for selling, raising money or other transactional activities. In short, we're doing this to make each other better. (Goodness knows I need it!)

We ask that you commit in your mind to do it for 6 months. Obviously, if that doesn't work out it doesn't work out. But it helps to be committed enough that people know you will bring the context they share to the next discussion. That commitment is kind of the ante to get an authentic experience.

We would suggest that we each come with some information (the leader's will be in Google slides, shared in advance so you know what you are getting into and can copy ... but you can do it however you want): 

1. A very brief personal and company intro
1. A persona for your customers
1. One or two goals for the next month
1. One or two challenges your company currently faces

We recommend avoiding super major strategy items or things like 2019 plans. Those are too big for the intro meeting. Once we know each other better in 3-4 months, maybe we can talk about quarterly plans.

Also, we know many of us wear many hats. The intended hat for this group is the "business leader" hat - such that we are all peers. While you may be an investor or have 3 businesses or be just starting trying to raise money, we would ask you to choose one interest to represent consistently in this venue.
